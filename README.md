# Kottans.LINQ

###This task is borrowed from one of incredibly good professionals.
###We will reveal it a little bit later because we want you to give it a try without actually looking into finished version of it.

Steps to fulfil it:
  1.	Choose a test suite
  2.	Run tests, see them passed
  3.	Comment out ``using System.Linq;``
  4.	Implement it in project Kottans.LINQ
  5.	Run tests again

We recommend to implement the following operators:
 - Select
 - Where
 - FirstOrDefault
 - Count
 - Sum
 
Other operators are optional
